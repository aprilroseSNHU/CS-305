Software Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial wanted us to confirm the security of their web apps so ensure proper security measure are in place for their clients.
  
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
  I think I did well with editing the existing files to implement the needed code to run test. It's important to code securely to ensure data and PIP is protected properly. Software security protects company proprietary information along with enhancing customer trust.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  I had a hard time realizing that I needed to change the pom.xml file. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  First, engineers need to know security best practices to enhance protection against vulnerabilities. Different industries are targeted by different types of threats, so implementing the correct type and amount of security is important and boils down to best practices and industry knowledge. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I debugged the code as I worked on it, which helped me find a few issues early on. Ensuring the code compiled and running the check beforehand helped too. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I would show them how I was able to make the necessary changes to the code to ensure the code ran and compiled correctly as well as followed industry best standards.
